The Hoe family and their children and grandchildren have continued to create dishes such as curry, Hoe’s sweet and sour chicken, and Hoe’s Szechuan chicken that alumni have listed for decades as some of their fondest food memories in Singapore. While the favorites have become healthier through the years, the Hoe brothers continue to embody the legacy of Singaporean food culture and the heart and soul experience of authentic local food done right.</p>

In fact, she's done something no other USA Girl Scout living outside of the United States has ever done. Hanna has been named a National Young Women of Distinction recipient.
                    </h5>
                    <p>So what exactly is the National Young Women of Distinction award? It's an honor awarded to only ten registered USA Girl Scouts every year - ten out of nearly two million! The National Young Women of Distinction award is given to USA Girl Scout Seniors and Ambassadors whose Gold Award projects demonstrated extraordinary leadership, had a measurable and sustainable impact and addressed a local challenge related to a national and/or global issue.

                        For her Gold Award project, Hanna co-founded a Rural Education and Development (READ) service club at Singapore American School to help fundraise and increase awareness of the READ Global program in Bhutan. Thanks to Hanna's project, a READ Bhutan center was opened in Yangthang Village, reaching 12,000 villagers with educational and training resources. The service club at SAS will continue to help provide resources to READ Bhutan which makes the project sustainable, a requirement of the Gold Award.</p>

                            The Singapore American School got a new playground for the Kindergarten kids!

Now the kindergartenrs can have lots of space to ru around but can also play on the fun structure. All the kindergarteners enjoyed the structure and the recess playground because now the have a lot more fun in that recess playground then the other ones.

                            The school has partnered with world-renowned education architectural firm, Fielding International to design the new campus and with local award-winning China Construction Development Co. for construction. The project will be completed in three phases, with phase one beginning on May 29 and the entire project scheduled for completion by fall 2026.

                            "Our greatest asset as a school is our educators. They are essential in creating engaging and meaningful learning experiences for each and every student who comes to SAS. We invest significantly in attracting, developing, and retaining some of the greatest teachers in the world. Our campus upgrade project represents one more way we are investing in our educators. This project will create learning environments with endless possibilities for our students and educators," said Tom Boasberg, superintendent of Singapore American School.
